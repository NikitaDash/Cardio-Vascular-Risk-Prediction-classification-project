# Project Title : Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

# Project Summary

The Machine Learning Cardiovascular Risk Prediction project aims to create an accurate predictive model for evaluating an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). This ambitious undertaking involves the application of advanced machine learning techniques to analyze diverse data sources, such as electronic health records and lifestyle information from patients. The primary objective of this model is to use these data points to forecast an individual's probability of developing CVD and pinpoint specific risk factors.

The project encompasses multiple essential phases, including the collection and thorough cleansing of data, the process of feature engineering to enhance the predictive capabilities, and the development of a robust machine learning model. This model will be meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset of patient information.

Ultimately, the project's success hinges on the precision of the predictive model and its capacity to accurately identify individuals who are at elevated risk of CVD. By achieving this, the project holds the potential to significantly contribute to the early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease, thereby improving overall public health.

# Objective :

Develop a predictive model to assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).

# Problem Statement :
The dataset we have here is from the Ongoing Cardiovascular study on the residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.

The Classfication goal is to predict whether the Patient has a 10-yrs. risk of Future Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

On the basis of the dataset we have to build such model that can predict whether Patient will be diseased or not.?
